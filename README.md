# cache-design
This is a repository of low level design of cache system

## Problem statement

Design a cache system (low level design) that will support the below operations:

- **Put**: This will allow user to put a value against a key in the cache.
- **Get**: This will allow user to get the previously saved value using key.
- **Eviction**: Cache should also support removal of some key in case cache is full, and we try to add new key value.

## Expectations
-  Code should be functionally correct.
-  Code should be modular, readable and clean.
-  Code should be extensible and scalable. Means it should be able to accommodate new requirements with minimal changes.
-  Code should have good OOPs design.
